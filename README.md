Creating a new react components at oneflare has never been easier with ```
generator-react-oneflare``` :)

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-oneflare using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-oneflare
```

## Creating Your Component

To instantly generate your component, all you need to do is specify the react app you want the component to be generated in, and the name of your component. Say you wanted to create a component named ```
BusinessDetails``` inside the react app named ```
BusinessRegistration``` for example. All you'd need to do is run:
```bash
yo react-oneflare BusinessRegistration BusinessDetails
```
In the root of your project. ```
generator-react-oneflare``` will search for the react app named ```BusinessRegistration
``` and create a directory named ```
BusinessDetails``` inside. This directory will contain all the files necessary for you to hit the ground running with your ```
BusinessDetails``` component.

## Creating a Class Component

By default, ```
generator-react-oneflare``` creates functional components. If you want to create a class component, all you need to do is add ```
--class``` to the end of your command.

If you wanted your "BusinessDetails" component to be a class component for example, you'd simply run:
```bash
  yo react-oneflare BusinessRegistration BusinessDetails --class
```

## Creating a new app

To create a new app named ```
InstantBooking```, all you need to do is run:
```bash
  yo react-oneflare:newApp InstantBooking
```
That's it! Your app will be created for you in the appropriate directory along with a starter component named after the app :).
Instructions on how to load your app in your view will be printed in the console.

## Changing hex colors to variables

To swap out all your hex colors for color variables in your styled component file, run the following command:

```bash
  yo react-oneflare:styles YourAppName YourComponentName
  ```

If you wanted to update your BusinessDetailsStyled file with all the latest color variables, you would run:

```
  yo react-oneflare:styles BusinessRegistration BusinessDetails
```
You'll then be asked if you want to overwrite the file. Answer Yes, or 'y'. And your done! All your hex colors will now be color variables!
