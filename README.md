# generator-react-oneflare

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-oneflare using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-oneflare
```

## Creating Your Component

To generate your component you need to specify the app you want the component to be generated in and the component name. Say you wanted to create a component named "BusinessDetails" inside the react app named "BusinessRegistration" for example. All you need to do is run:
```bash
yo react-oneflare BusinessRegistration BusinessDetails
```
In the root of your project. ```
generator-react-oneflare``` will search for the react app named BusinessRegistration and create a directory named BusinessDetails inside. This directory will contain all the files necessary for you to hit the ground running with your component.

## Creating a Class Component
By default, ```
generator-react-oneflare``` creates functional components. If you want to create a class component, all you need to do is add ```
--class``` to the end of your command.

If you wanted your "BusinessDetails" component to be a class component for example, you'd simply run:
```bash
  yo react-oneflare BusinessRegistration BusinessDetails --class
```
